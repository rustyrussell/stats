stats - simple filter to gather numbers in repeated text.

Ever written a little benchmark program to print out results, and run
it 100 times to see how much it varied?  This filter finds identical
lines and collapses all the numbers into a range, average and standard
deviation; it can also print out all the numbers in CSV form for import
into spreadsheets, etc.

Example usage:

$ ./mybenchmark
Using CPUS 0 and 3
Guest: notified 156437, pinged 156251
Host: notified 156251, pinged 78219

$ for i in `seq 100`; do ./mybenchmark; done | stats
Using CPUS 0 and 3
Guest: notified 156437-156610(156548+/-40), pinged 156251
Host: notified 156251, pinged 78219-78305(78274+/-27)

Compilation notes:
1) You can use an external config.h, but a trivial program generates it
   for you and is usually right.
2) The ccan/ directory modules are straight from the http://ccodearchive.net/
   project, brought in using create-ccan-tree.

Good luck!
